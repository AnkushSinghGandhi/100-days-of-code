# 100 Days Of Code with Pomodoro Technique - Log

Doing #100DaysOfCode challnge with the end goal of learning **Flutter** and **DSA**. Also I'll be posting one video daily on my YT channel talking about my learnings at that day to improve my  English speaking skills.

### Day 1: October 21 2021

**Today's Progress**: I have completed **4 Pomodoro round of DSA** in wich I started with **Big O** notation then I checked complexities of different algorithms, learnt efficient way of solving problems, explored some examples, learnt about space and time complexities.

Also I have completed **3 Pomodoro rounds of Flutter** where I reviewed some of my old flutter code to revise the concepts and syntax of flutter. 

**Thoughts**: I never thought that it was going to be that hard because of a 2 - 3 months gap that I took.
